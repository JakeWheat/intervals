Small, currently haskell project to implement a rough u_minus
relational operator, and then to use this to create some helpers for
analysing lists of events (with start and end time), which may be
nested, particularly to get the times of an event without including
the times of any contained events, 'self times'. This is for a toy
profiling system.

Here is the initial self times code in postgresql, which is pretty
slow, and I can't find an easy way to convince myself it is correct.

This project is reimplementing this calculation in haskell, with
proper tests, and eventually hopefully a nice optimised implementation
which can either be ported to postgres SQL, or possibly implemented as
a helper function in haskell or c++.
